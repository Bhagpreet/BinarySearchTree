# Introduction

This code contains a binary search tree data structure coded from scratch, which includes a BSTree class and a Node class. The binary search tree contains nodes that hold one data element, and has a left and right child, which may be null. In a binary search tree, for any given node, the left child's element value will always be smaller than the parent element, and the right child's element value will always be larger than the parent element. This allows for an average time complexity of O(logn) to search for an element in the BST.

The Node class store a data element of type string. Within the main function, there is a menu displayed in the standard output, allowing a user to insert a string, remove a string, search for a string, return the smallest value, return largest value, or return the height of the tree.
